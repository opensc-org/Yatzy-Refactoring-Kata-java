# Yatzy

Yatzy is a simple dice game. Each player rolls five six-sided dice. They can re-roll some or all of the dice up to three times (including the original roll).

The player then places the roll in a category, such as ones, twos, fives, pair, two pairs etc (see the rules below). If the roll is compatible with the category, the player gets a score for the roll according to the rules. If the roll is not compatible with the category, the player scores zero for the roll.

# Yatzy Refactoring Kata

This Refactoring Kata was designed by Jon Jagger and modified by [my books](https://leanpub.com/u/emilybache), so that the rules more closely match the original game.

## Kata Description

The Yatzy class implements calculation of the outcome for different categories. Your task is to find all issues in this class and refactor it.
The project contains a test fixture. It's valid and comprehensive and does not need to be changed.
